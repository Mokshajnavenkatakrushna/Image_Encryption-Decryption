# **Secure Image Encryption Using AES-GCM for Confidential Data Protection**


The project presents a web-based system for encrypting and decrypting images using the AES-GCM (Advanced Encryption Standard â€“ Galois/Counter Mode) algorithm. 
Developed by K. Kumara Siva Charan, P. Sai Manoj Kumar, and P. Mokshajna Venkata Krushna under the guidance of Mrs. Baghavathi Priya S at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, 
Chennai, this project addresses the critical need for secure image transmission and storage in an era of increasing cyber threats. The system ensures both confidentiality 
and authentication, making it suitable for protecting sensitive image data such as medical records, legal documents, and personal photographs.

The problem statement highlights the risks associated with storing and sharing images online, where traditional encryption methods like Triple DES and RSA are either computationally inefficient or vulnerable to modern cryptographic attacks. To overcome these challenges, the proposed system integrates AES-GCM, which not only encrypts image data but also generates an authentication tag to prevent unauthorized modifications. This ensures that encrypted images remain tamper-proof and can only be accessed by authorized users. Additionally, the system features email-based encryption delivery, where users receive their encrypted images and password details securely through email using Flask-Mail and SMTP.

The methodology details the implementation of both frontend and backend components. The frontend, built using React.js, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, provides an intuitive user interface where users can upload images for encryption, receive encrypted files via email, and decrypt images using a password. The backend, developed using Flask, handles encryption, decryption, file storage, and email transmission. The encryption process involves users uploading an image, entering a password, and encrypting it with AES-GCM, using PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) to derive a secure key. The encrypted file is then stored securely and emailed to the recipient. For decryption, the user uploads the encrypted file, enters the correct password, and retrieves the original image after the system verifies the authentication tag.

The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the system in ensuring secure image transmission. Users can successfully encrypt images, receive them via email, and decrypt them without data loss. The error-handling mechanisms prevent unauthorized access, incorrect password attempts, and corrupted file processing, further enhancing security. The literature review compares different encryption methods such as AES, DES, 3DES, and RSA, confirming that AES-GCM is the most secure and efficient method for image encryption due to its balance of speed, security, and integrity verification.

In conclusion, this project provides a robust and practical solution for securing sensitive images, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and accessibility. The combination of modern cryptographic techniques, secure email transmission, and a user-friendly interface makes it highly suitable for applications in healthcare, legal documentation, finance, and confidential data storage.
